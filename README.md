# go-beholder
This project is a learning endeavor where I implement some of the container types similar to those found in C++'s Standard Template Library (STL), using Go. 
The goal is to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as to improve my proficiency in Go. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
